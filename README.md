The Vita Handbook is a comprehensive offline Vita hacking guide. It aims at helping users get the best out of their Vita handheld. For more information, read https://github.com/xy2iii/vita-handbook/blob/master/Vita%20Handbook.txt

For contributors, if you want to properly edit the guide (following formatting), use vim and add these lines to your ~/.vimrc:
```
set tabstop=4      " Tab size
set shiftwidth=4   " Indent size
set softtabstop=4  " Interpret 4 spaces as tabs
set expandtab      " Set tab to insert spaces
set smarttab       " Backspace will delete a 'tab' (4 spaces);
                   " if there is not an even number (eg 7 spaces),
                   " it will delete the remaining number (3 spaces)
                   " then the emulated tab
set tw=98          " Hard wrap on 98 characters
set autoindent     " When starting a new line (either hardwrap or
                   " via pressing Enter), follow previous line's
                   " indenting
```
